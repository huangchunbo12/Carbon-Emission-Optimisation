# Carbon-Emission-Optimisation
Evolutionary-Carbon: An Evolutionary Algorithm Optimized Integrated
Prediction for Peak Carbon Pathway Analysis
Project Profile
This project aims to establish a carbon peak prediction model that integrates (ALA-LSTM) and Adaboost integration algorithms to mine the key driving factors in the historical carbon emission trajectory, and then make high-precision predictions of future carbon emission trends, and assist in the formation of regional-level and industry-level carbon emission reduction strategies.
The system adopts a composite modeling approach of deep learning and integrated learning, combining heterogeneous carbon emission data from multiple sources (e.g., energy consumption, industrial activities, policy events, climate variables, etc.) to achieve an end-to-end intelligent modeling process from feature construction, model training, path analysis to peak prediction.
Core methodology
ALA-LSTM: Based on the improved version of ALA LSTM network, a dynamic temporal attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically capture important time nodes and phase patterns in the carbon emission time series.
Adaboost Regression Integration: An integrated framework formed by training multiple ALA-LSTM sub-models to improve the overall robustness and generalization performance, especially for non-smooth carbon emission time series.
Pathway analysis: Output possible carbon emission pathways for the next few years, combining key policy assumptions, regional development scenarios, and visualization of peak time points and carbon neutral pathways.
Environment Configuration
This project runs on Python 3.8 and depends on the following key libraries (see below for some of the dependencies):
